# Lecture Notes : Week 1

## Focused vs diffuse mode

Metaphors and analogies provide powerful techniques for learning

Two ways of thinking :
- focused mode
- diffuse mode 

## Procrastination, memory & sleep

Procrastination is caused by a neurodiscomfort, which actually disappear minutes after we start the task. 
To avoid this discomfort, the brain take our attention to something else. This is procrastination.

The pomodoro technique is a solution to avoid procrastination. 

Practice makes permanent, repetition over time.
The diffuse mode helps to understand abstracts and new ideas

### Memory
Memory is divided in two parts :

- Short term memory, the working Memory which can hold 4 to 7 chunks of information
- Long term, like a storage warehouse 

We need to move new knowledge from the short term memory to the long term memory. 
A good technique to do that is "spaced repetition".

### Sleep

Sleep helps the brain to wash toxins
Sleep is when the brain strengthen important part of the memory (and neurological connexions)

### Learning tricks from Dr Terrence Sejnowski

- Learning by osmosis from expert 
- Learning by doing
- Being in a creative environment is really important 
- Be persistent, staying in the course
- Look at things with a different perspective

## Creativity

- Solving (by himself) an already solved problem is also creativity (it's new for you)
- Openness and Nonconformism are important to be creative 
- Stepping back is important to get an overview of the current problem

## Writing

- Use mind mapping (or clustering) to activate the "diffuse mode" of the brain to gather information
- Don't do outlining before writing
- Don't edit while your write

## Learning a new langage 

- Don't be afraid of making mistakes
- Use mnemonics techniques to help you remember things, pure repetition is not a very good tool to remember vocabulary
- You can use a kind of pomodoro on bigger period, like 6 days of study the 1 day off, or 3 weeks of studies 1 week off
